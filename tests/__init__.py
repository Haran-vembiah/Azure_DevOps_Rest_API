"""
This package contains all the unit tests for the TAF. The unit tests are organized in a way that each package
contains the unit tests for a specific component of the TAF. For example, the package 'sut_hci' contains all the
unit tests for the SUT HCI abstraction layer, while the package 'orchestrator' contains all the unit tests for the
orchestrator component.


.. warning:: These are the unit tests for the test automation framework itself, not for the SUTs.
