"""
The mg or "MacGyver" package contains methods for unorthodox ways of interacting with external systems,
usually with one of the SUTs.

When the SUT doesn't provide an API to support the test, we can use the mg package to interact with it and
emulate the user's behaviour, or to patch the SUT's behaviour to make it (more) testable.

The mg package is named after the TV character MacGyver, who was famous for using whatever he had at hand to solve
problems. Break out the duct tape and paper clips!
