"""
Abstract classes for implementing Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) for the SUT. The user of this package
can use these basic classes for implementing interactions with the SUT's GUI or CLI. Even though the package is
named "abs_hci", it can be used for implementing interactions using other patterns, like the Strategy pattern,
or they can be fully ignored and the user can implement their own classes from scratch.
